**Table Responsive Strategy:**

// Desktop columns: All data visible
{
  title: "العضو",
  responsive: ["md"], // Hidden on mobile/tablet
  render: // Full member card with avatar
}

// Mobile columns: Condensed information
{
  title: "الاسم",
  responsive: ["xs", "sm"], // Only visible on mobile/tablet
  render: // Stacked layout with name, email, role tags
}
```

## Mobile-Responsive CSS

**Location**: `my-vite-app/src/styles/mobile-responsive.css`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Essential info shown first, details on larger screens
2. **Touch-Friendly Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets
3. **Readable Typography**: Scalable fonts with proper line heights
4. **Efficient Navigation**: Icon-based tabs save space on mobile

## Browser Support

- **Mobile Browsers**: iOS Safari 12+, Chrome Mobile 70+, Samsung Internet 10+

- **Responsive Breakpoints**: 640px (sm), 768px (md), 1024px (lg), 1280px (xl)

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Test all components on mobile devices (iOS/Android)
- [ ] Verify tab navigation works on touch devices
- [ ] Test table scrolling and column visibility
- [ ] Verify modal behavior on different screen sizes
- [ ] Test accessibility with screen readers

### Automated Testing

- [ ] Add responsive design tests using viewport manipulation
- [ ] Test component behavior at different breakpoints
- [ ] Verify ARIA attributes are properly set
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation flow

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Immediate)

- [ ] Add swipe gestures for tab navigation on mobile
- [ ] Implement pull-to-refresh functionality
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for mobile interactions

### Phase 2 (Medium Term)

- [ ] Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- [ ] Offline functionality for critical features
- [ ] Advanced touch gestures (pinch-to-zoom for images)

### Phase 3 (Long Term)

- [ ] Native mobile app development
- [ ] Voice navigation support
- [ ] Advanced accessibility features

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript

- All components are fully typed with proper interfaces
- Props and state are strictly typed
- Event handlers include proper typing

### Best Practices Followed

- **DRY Principle**: Reusable responsive utility classes
- **SOLID Principles**: Modular, single-responsibility components
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and state management

## Deployment Considerations

- Ensure mobile-responsive.css is included in build process
- Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- Monitor Core Web Vitals for mobile performance
- Consider CDN optimization for mobile users

## Maintenance

- Regular testing on new mobile devices and browsers
- Monitor mobile usage analytics
- Update responsive breakpoints based on user data
- Keep accessibility standards up to date

## Summary
