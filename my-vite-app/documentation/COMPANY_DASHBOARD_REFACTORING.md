# CompanyDashboard Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the `CompanyDashboard.tsx` component to use the modern `useSubscription` hook instead of legacy subscription management. This improves code maintainability, provides better error handling, and implements feature-based UI restrictions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Legacy Subscription Code

- **Before**: Direct access to `company?.subscriptionStatus`, `company?.subscriptionType`
- **After**: Uses `subscriptionData` from the modern `useSubscription` hook
- **Benefits**: Centralized subscription logic, better error handling, real-time updates

### 2. Enhanced Subscription Status Handling

- Updated status mapping functions to handle modern Stripe subscription statuses
- Added support for statuses: `active`, `trialing`, `incomplete`, `past_due`, `unpaid`, `canceled`, `inactive`
- Better Arabic translations for each status

### 3. Feature-Based UI Restrictions

- **Listing Creation**: Limited to 5 free listings, unlimited for premium users
- **Team Management**: Restricted based on subscription plan team member limits
- **Feature Indicators**: Visual indicators showing which features are available/unavailable

### 4. Improved Alert System

- **Error Handling**: Shows subscription loading errors with retry button
- **Status Alerts**: Dynamic alerts based on subscription status
- **Feature Promotions**: Contextual upgrade prompts for premium features

### 5. Enhanced Subscription Information Display

- Shows current plan name and billing interval
- Displays subscription end date
- Shows pricing information
- Feature availability matrix

### 6. Modern React Patterns

- Proper use of `useCallback` for performance optimization
- Clean separation of concerns between subscription logic and UI
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling

## New Features Added

### 1. Features Dashboard

- Visual indicators for all subscription features
- Color-coded availability status
- Direct upgrade call-to-action for inactive features

### 2. Smart Restrictions

- Error recovery mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages in Arabic

## Code Quality Improvements

### 1. TypeScript Safety

- Proper type checking for subscription data
- Fixed type errors in feature checking
- Better null safety patterns

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- Memoized callback functions
- Reduced re-renders through proper dependency arrays
- Optimized state updates

### 3. Maintainability
