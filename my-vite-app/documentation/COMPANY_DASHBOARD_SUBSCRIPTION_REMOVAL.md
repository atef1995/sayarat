# Company Dashboard Subscription Removal

## Overview

Removed subscription-related UI elements and properties from the Company Dashboard since subscription management is handled separately in account settings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Company Dashboard Component (`CompanyDashboard.tsx`)

- **Removed**: Subscription status badge from company header
- **Removed**: Subscription type badge from company header
- **Replaced**: Subscription badges with company information badges (city, license status)
- **Updated**: Component documentation to clarify separation of concerns

### 2. Company Types (`company.types.ts`)

- **Removed**: `subscriptionType?: string`
- **Removed**: `subscriptionStatus?: string`
- **Removed**: `subscriptionId?: string`
- **Added**: Documentation comment explaining subscription properties are handled separately

### 3. UI Improvements

- **Enhanced**: Company header now shows relevant business information (city, license status)
- **Cleaner**: Dashboard focuses purely on company operations
- **Focused**: Each component has a single responsibility

## Benefits

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- ✅ Company dashboard focuses on company operations
- ✅ Subscription management handled in dedicated account settings
- ✅ Cleaner code with single responsibility principle

### 2. Better User Experience

- ✅ Reduced cognitive load on company dashboard
- ✅ Subscription management accessible from account settings
- ✅ Company information more prominent and relevant

### 3. Maintainability

- ✅ Easier to maintain separate subscription logic
- ✅ Less coupling between components
- ✅ More modular architecture

## Component Structure After Changes

```
CompanyDashboard/
├── Overview Tab (stats and analytics)
├── Profile Tab (company information)
├── Images Tab (logo and header image)
└── Members Tab (team management)
```

Subscription management remains accessible through:

- Account Settings → Subscription Tab
- User profile menu → Subscription management

## Type Safety

All TypeScript definitions updated to reflect the architectural changes while maintaining type safety and backward compatibility where needed.

## Future Considerations

- Company dashboard can focus on business-specific features
- Subscription features can be implemented through feature flags without cluttering the company dashboard
- Better separation allows for independent development of both areas
