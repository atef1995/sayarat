## What Was Fixed

### Latest Fixes (July 9, 2025)

1. **UUID Validation**: Fixed invalid UUID format error in `getViewsByUser` function
   - Added `isValidUUID()` helper function with proper UUID regex validation
   - Enhanced parameter validation to check UUID format before database queries
   - Added comprehensive UUID validation tests

2. **Database Schema**: Fixed column name mismatch in `postQueries.js`
   - Changed `bp.currency` to `bp.price_currency` to match actual database schema

3. **PostgreSQL Interval Syntax**: Fixed `INTERVAL 7 DAY` to `INTERVAL '7 days'`

4. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive validation and error handling

5. **Query Utilities**: Created reusable utility functions for PostgreSQL queries

6. **Testing**: Enhanced test coverage with better error reporting and UUID validation

## Next Steps

If you want to enable full functionality with user_agent and referrer tracking:

1. Run the migration:

```bash
npx knex migrate:latest
```

2. The service will automatically detect and use the new columns.

The original database error should now be completely resolved! ðŸŽ‰
