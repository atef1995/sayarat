# Security Fix: Express Rate Limiting Configuration

## Problem

The original configuration was using `app.set('trust proxy', true)` which creates a security vulnerability by allowing anyone to bypass IP-based rate limiting through header spoofing.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Secure Proxy Trust Configuration

```javascript
// Only trust the first proxy (Caddy) in production
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.set('trust proxy', 1); // Trust only first proxy
} else {
  app.set('trust proxy', false); // No proxies in development
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting

- **Global Rate Limiter**: 1000 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Auth Rate Limiter**: 10 authentication attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- **Payment Rate Limiter**: 5 payment attempts per hour per IP

### 3. Security Improvements

- Proper IP detection with trusted proxy validation
- Rate limit headers for client information
- Skipped rate limiting for health checks
- Custom key generator for better IP detection
- Error responses with retry information

### 4. Code Quality Fixes

- Fixed unused variable linting errors
- Replaced unsafe `process.exit()` with proper error handling
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Followed Single Responsibility Principle

## Security Benefits

✅ Prevents IP spoofing attacks
✅ Blocks brute force authentication attempts  
✅ Limits payment fraud attempts
✅ Maintains performance for legitimate users
✅ Provides proper error feedback

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test rate limiting in production environment
2. Verify IP detection works correctly behind Caddy
3. Test authentication limits with failed login attempts
4. Monitor rate limit headers in browser dev tools

This configuration now follows security best practices and prevents the ERR_ERL_PERMISSIVE_TRUST_PROXY vulnerability.
