/**
 * Company Subscription Activation - SUCCESS SUMMARY
 *
 * ISSUE RESOLVED:
 * ===============
 * Company subscriptions were not being activated after Stripe payments.
 * The webhook was successfully processing payments but not updating company status.
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE:
 * ===========
 * 1. Database constraint only allowed 'monthly'/'yearly' but backend used 'pending'
 * 2. Webhook service was missing company subscription activation logic
 * 3. Payment succeeded but company remained in 'pending' status
 *
 * SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
 * ====================
 * 1. âœ… Fixed database constraint to allow 'pending' subscription type
 * 2. âœ… Enhanced StripeWebhookService with company activation logic
 * 3. âœ… Added _handleCompanySubscriptionActivation method
 * 4. âœ… Added _activateCompanySubscription method
 * 5. âœ… Added graceful error handling for payment recording failures
 * 6. âœ… Integrated with invoice.payment_succeeded webhook events
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
 * ==========================
 * - MODULAR DESIGN: Separate methods for different activation scenarios
 * - ERROR BOUNDARIES: Graceful handling of payment recording failures
 * - SEPARATION OF CONCERNS: Company activation independent of payment recording
 * - DEPENDENCY INJECTION: Proper service integration
 * - COMPREHENSIVE LOGGING: Detailed tracking of activation process
 *
 * TEST RESULTS:
 * =============
 * Company ID: aa6c3600-8bb3-4a3d-98f3-fcc81ae8e005
 *
 * BEFORE ACTIVATION:
 * - subscription_type: "pending"
 * - subscription_status: "pending"
 * - subscription_id: "sub_1RdrAkPIR1o3pZmOTxxxxxxx"
 *
 * AFTER ACTIVATION:
 * - subscription_type: "monthly"     âœ… UPDATED
 * - subscription_status: "active"    âœ… ACTIVATED
 * - subscription_id: "sub_1RdrAkPIR1o3pZmOTxxxxxxx"
 *
 * NEXT STEPS:
 * ===========
 * 1. Test with actual Stripe webhook in production
 * 2. Frontend should now show active subscription status
 * 3. Company dashboard should reflect premium features access
 * 4. Monitor webhook logs for successful activations
 *
 * FILES MODIFIED:
 * ===============
 * - backend/service/stripeWebhookService.js (Enhanced with company activation)
 * - Database constraint (Manual fix applied)
 * - backend/scripts/test-existing-company-activation.js (Test verification)
 *
 * #TODO: Add unit tests for webhook activation scenarios
 * #TODO: Add frontend notification when subscription activates
 * #TODO: Add admin panel for manual subscription management
 * #TODO: Add subscription expiration and renewal logic
