# Blog System Fixes Summary - July 9, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. UUID Validation Error in `getViewsByUser`

**Problem**:

- Function was failing with PostgreSQL error: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "some-user-id"`
- Test was using an invalid UUID format string instead of proper UUID

**Solution**:

- Added `isValidUUID()` helper function with proper UUID regex validation
- Enhanced `validateViewParams()` to check UUID format before database queries
- Updated tests to use valid UUID format: `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`
- Added comprehensive UUID validation tests with both valid and invalid formats

**Files Modified**:

- `backend/service/blog/views.js` - Added UUID validation helper and enhanced parameter validation
- `backend/test/blog/test-views.js` - Updated tests with proper UUID format and validation tests

### 2. Database Schema Mismatch in `postQueries.js`

**Problem**:

- `getPostBySlug` function was trying to select `bp.currency` column which doesn't exist
- Actual column name in database is `bp.price_currency`

**Solution**:

- Fixed column name from `bp.currency` to `bp.price_currency` in the select statement
- Verified against actual database schema to ensure all columns exist

**Files Modified**:

- `backend/service/blog/postQueries.js` - Fixed column name on line 342

### 3. Test Enhancements

**Improvements**:

- Added UUID validation test cases for both valid and invalid UUIDs
- Enhanced error handling in tests to gracefully handle expected errors
- Added test for tracking post views with valid user UUIDs
- Improved test output and error reporting

**Files Modified**:

- `backend/test/blog/test-views.js` - Added UUID validation tests and enhanced error handling
