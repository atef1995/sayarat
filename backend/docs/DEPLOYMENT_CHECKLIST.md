# Webhook Deployment Checklist

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Database Setup

- [ ] Run `webhook_events.sql` to create the table (for new deployments)
- [ ] Run `webhook_events_migration.sql` to update existing table
- [ ] Verify all indexes are created
- [ ] Test database connection and permissions
- [ ] Set up database backup strategy

### 2. Environment Configuration

- [ ] Set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in production environment
- [ ] Set `ENDPOINT_SECRET` from Stripe webhook configuration
- [ ] Configure `DATABASE_URL` with proper connection pooling
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Configure logging levels appropriately
- [ ] Set up log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack, CloudWatch)

### 3. Stripe Configuration

- [ ] Create webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Configure webhook URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/payment/webhook`
- [ ] Subscribe to events: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
- [ ] Copy webhook signing secret to `ENDPOINT_SECRET`
- [ ] Test webhook endpoint from Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Configure appropriate retry settings in Stripe

### 4. Security Verification

- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enabled and working
- [ ] Test webhook signature verification
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is working
- [ ] Test with invalid/missing signatures
- [ ] Verify sensitive data is not logged in full
- [ ] Check that webhook responds appropriately to Stripe

### 5. Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Configure application monitoring (e.g., New Relic, DataDog)
- [ ] Set up alerts for webhook failures
- [ ] Monitor webhook processing times
- [ ] Set up alerts for rate limit violations
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Set up log monitoring for security events

### 6. Performance Testing

- [ ] Load test webhook endpoint
- [ ] Test concurrent webhook processing
- [ ] Verify database performance under load
- [ ] Test rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Measure average processing times

## üîß Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Functional Testing

- [ ] Send test webhook from Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Verify successful payment processing
- [ ] Test failed payment handling
- [ ] Verify email notifications work
- [ ] Check database records are created correctly

### 2. Security Testing

- [ ] Attempt webhook with invalid signature
- [ ] Test rate limiting behavior
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Test error handling doesn't leak information

### 3. Monitoring Validation

- [ ] Verify logs are being collected
- [ ] Check monitoring dashboards show data
- [ ] Test alert notifications
- [ ] Verify performance metrics are tracked

## üìä Key Metrics to Monitor

### Performance Metrics

- Webhook processing time (avg, p95, p99)
- Database query performance
- Memory and CPU usage
- Request rate and response times

### Security Metrics

- Rate limiting triggers
- Signature verification failures
- Invalid request patterns
- Unusual traffic spikes

### Business Metrics

- Payment success rate
- Email delivery rate
- Failed webhook processing
- Duplicate event detection

## üö® Incident Response

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### High Error Rate

1. Check Stripe service status
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check application logs for errors
4. Verify environment variables

#### Signature Verification Failures

1. Verify ENDPOINT_SECRET is correct
2. Check webhook URL in Stripe
3. Verify HTTPS is working
4. Check for proxy/CDN interference

#### Database Issues

1. Check connection pool settings
2. Monitor database performance
3. Verify table exists and is accessible
4. Check for lock conflicts

#### Rate Limiting Issues

1. Check for unusual traffic patterns
2. Verify rate limit settings are appropriate
3. Check for bot/automated traffic
4. Consider adjusting limits if legitimate
